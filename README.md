# Unsupervised-Learning
This project explores the use of unsupervised learning techniques to analyze a real-world dataset and discover meaningful patterns without relying on labeled outputs.The California Housing dataset, a publicly available dataset from the UCI/StatLib repository (accessed via scikit-learn), was selected due to its rich numerical features and real-estate relevance.
The goal of this analysis is to:
•	Preprocess and prepare the dataset for machine learning tasks
•	Apply K-means and Agglomerative Clustering
•	Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores
•	Visualize clusters using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and optional t-SNE
•	Evaluate model performance using clustering metrics
•	Interpret the resulting clusters in relation to housing characteristics
•	Provide a strategy for deployment and ongoing monitoring of the chosen model
This project demonstrates core concepts in data preprocessing, unsupervised learning, cluster evaluation, dimensionality reduction, model interpretation, and practical real-world deployment considerations.


Run in Google Colab
1.	Open the notebook directly in Google Colab using the link provided in the repository.
2.	Ensure the Colab runtime is set to:
	Python 3
CPU runtime (GPU is not required)
3.	Run the notebook cell by cell from top to bottom:
All required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib) are standard in Colab.
4.	No additional data download is required:
The California Housing dataset is automatically loaded using fetch_california_housing().
